    <h2>Discription</h2>
    <p>
        Cherries jubilee is a refreshing dessert, especially after a hearty meal.<br> This does have to be prepared immediately before serving, but does not take a lot of time.<br> Your guests will enjoy the blue flames when the brandy is ignited!
    </p>
    <h3>ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>¼ cup cold water</li>
        <li>¼ cup orange juice</li>
        <li>1 pound Bing or other dark, sweet cherries, rinsed and pitted (or use frozen pitted cherries)</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon finely grated orange zest</li>
        <li>3 cups vanilla bean ice cream</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon cherry extract</li>
        <li>¼ cup brandy</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>Whisk sugar and cornstarch together in a wide saucepan. Stir in water and</p>
    <p>orange juice; bring to a boil over medium-high heat, whisking until thickened.</p>
    <P>Stir in cherries and orange zest; return to a boil, then reduce heat, and simmer</P>
    <P>for 10 minutes. While cherries are cooking, spoon ice cream into serving bowls.</P>

    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>Remove cherries from heat and stir in cherry extract. Pour in brandy and ignite</p>
    <p>with a long lighter. Gently shake the pan until blue flame has extinguished itself.</p>
    <P>Spoon cherries over ice cream.</P>

    <h3>Note on flambéing:</h3>
    <p>The flames may get quite high when flambéing, so pay attention to anything</p>
    <p>flammable above and around where you ignite the cherries. When the initial</p>
    <p>large flame has died down, a small blue flame will continue to burn for several</p>
    <p>seconds. Shake or stir the cherries gently to expose more alcohol to the flame,</p>
    <p>being careful that they do not burn. The goal is to have the small, blue flame</p>
    <p>burn for as long as possible, thereby reducing the raw alcohol flavor,</p>
    <p>caramelizing the sugars, and entertaining your guests!</p>
